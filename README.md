# Who are we (TCMC)?
  1. We are developing DRG (Diagnosis Related Group)
  2. We are analyzing the cost data for each hospital. 
  The hospital firstly sends cost data ([Unit Cost Data.pptx](https://github.com/PtkPlum/Thai-CaseMix-Centre/files/6983741/Unit.Cost.Data.pptx)) to us. And we will use unit cost analysis and data visualization to explain the cost behavior of hospital.
